I am currently a **Visiting Researcher at the University of Cambridge** supervised by Prof. Nicholas D. Lane, and a **PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Warwick** supervised by Dr Ligang He.
My research focuses on **secure federated learning** and its applications in **graph neural networks** and **distributed AI systems**.

I’m passionate about developing trustworthy and privacy-preserving learning systems that remain robust even in adversarial or dynamic environments.
